How to Play – Prison Escape

You wake up in a prison cell. Your goal is to escape by making the right choices.
Use simple commands like "yes", "no", "left", or "right" to move forward.

In Normal mode, you have 2 lives. Each wrong answer to a math question costs 1 life.
In Hard mode, you have no second chances – one mistake and you're caught!

Answer multiplication questions to progress and choose wisely at each location.
Make the wrong move, and you might run into a guard... or worse.

Good luck escaping!
